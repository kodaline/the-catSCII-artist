# Introduction

The *catSCII artist* is a plugin that gives you random facts and uses the `cowsay` package giving them back in ascii art.
Ask the Cheshire Cat for a random fact and wait!

# Requirement

## Cheshire Cat AI

To start using the plugin you need to have the Cheshire Cat AI up and running. To do so visit the repository [here](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core) and follow the easy steps to install it.

Once you have setup the `cat`, you need to:

1. Install the plugin (`Admin page` -> `Plugins tab`)

2. Set your NINJAS_API_KEY in the plugin settings ([ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com))

3. Optionally, deactivate the cats ascii art if you want to use default cowsay animals

4. and then just have fun!

If you want to dive into the plugin, consider taking a look at [dive into](dive.md) readme.

# Credits

`cowsay` for GNU/Linux was initially written in perl by Tony Monroe. More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay).

# TODO

- add custom ascii art support by using the plugin settings or by directly uploading the `.txt` file into the cat's declarative memory

- use the files into `cats` folder to import the cats ascii arts

- translation of the random fact in a custom language

- eventually drop the use of external API service for the random facts (ninja)
